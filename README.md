# BME-40005_Advanced_Medical_Imaging_Systems

Task - 1 - Fundamental Image Manipulation and Spatial Filtering: This module implements core image processing techniques using MATLAB. Tasks include performing geometric transformations (scaling and rotation) on CT images and applying histogram equalisation to X-ray data to enhance contrast,. It also covers spatial domain processing, including the application of high and low pass filters to MRI scans, image sharpening, and noise removal algorithms to correct salt-and-pepper noise,.


Task-2 - CT Reconstruction and Metadata Extraction:  Building on the fundamental tasks, this module adds complex medical imaging operations. It involves creating a laminogram (CT reconstruction) from a provided sinogram, requiring the calculation of back-projections. Additionally, it includes a function to programmatically extract and display patient metadata from DICOM medical image files.


Task - 3 - Frequency Domain Processing: This module extends the project into the frequency domain using Fourier Transforms. It includes the design and application of a Fourier-based low pass filter on X-ray images, ensuring the avoidance of ringing artefacts. Furthermore, it implements spectral filtering techniques to identify and remove periodic diagonal noise from medical images.
